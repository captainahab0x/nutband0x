# nutband

Experimental minimalistic python-only user interface for cashu, using
[cashu nutshell](https://github.com/cashubtc/nutshell) implementation.

Should be buildable to apk and ipa through buildozer, running on android,
ios and desktop platforms. I have not managed to build anything else than
desktop now though.

## Goal

The goal of this project is to experiment with cashu over [Reticulum](https://github.com/markqvist/Reticulum) mesh network protocol using
[LXMF](https://github.com/markqvist/LXMF).

We'll see where do I get.

## Status

Right now, it is just a normal GUI for a nutshell mint.
Only sending and receiving tokens is enabled, mint selection or invoices 
does not work yet. Right now it uses https.
